        <h1>My Family Life</h1>
        <center><img src="./MYFAMILY.jpeg" alt="Family Photo" height="350" width="600"></center>
        <p>My family consists of four members: my father, a farmer; my mother, a homemaker; and my younger sister, who is currently studying BSc Nursing. Our familyâ€™s income relies solely on my father. I completed my studies last year but am currently unemployed.</p>

        <h1>School Life</h1>
        <p>I began my education at Panchayat Union Primary School, where I completed my studies from 1st to 5th grade. I then joined another school for my higher education, where I spent seven years and served as the class leader throughout that time.</p>

    <div class="head" id="three">
        <h1>College Life</h1>
        <p>I was always interested in computer science, but my parents initially encouraged me to pursue biology, which resulted in low scores in physics and chemistry. After completing school, I made the bold decision to pursue a BE in Computer Science and Engineering at VI Institute of Technology, which was conveniently located near my grandmother's house. The fees were also comparatively lower than other colleges.</p>
        <p>During my time there, I learned a great deal and had the opportunity to share my interests with others. In my final year, our department faced a staffing issue, with only one instructor available. I took on the responsibility of conducting practical exams and teaching lab programs. I assisted with system repairs and learned a lot about system components and troubleshooting. Eventually, I was able to help prepare the lab exam systems and even repair some PCs that had issues.</p>

    <div class="head" id="four">
        <h1>Work Experience: Unforgettable Moments</h1>
        <p>I have six months of experience in the non-IT sector, primarily in banking operations. I passed the interview based on SQL technical knowledge and completed six months of training. After joining the company, I analyzed the original business model and found that many employees were not receiving confirmations even after eight months, which led me to reject the full-time offer.</p>
        <p>My team leader and manager advised me to pursue my core field. I discussed my decision with my manager, who conducted my interview. Although the company was good, I was dissatisfied with the multi-tasking work that did not involve technical tasks, which I love. I worked in credit card support at Indian Bank for two months, but the workload was minimal. I later shifted to Indian Overseas Bank and joined the Core Banking Team (CBS), which again did not require technical skills and involved repetitive tasks.</p>
        <p>During this experience, I learned to choose opportunities based on employee reviews. On my last day at Indian Bank, a colleague asked for help logging into the system. When my manager noticed, he advised against it, and I realized that I had made a mistake. This experience taught me valuable lessons about workplace boundaries and the importance of focusing on the right opportunities.</p>
